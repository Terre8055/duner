Before I delved into devops and cloud computing, I participated in an intense 3-month devops bootcamp organised at RGT. I experienced the world of devops from writing bash scripts to fully automating software deployment on cloud and on-prem infra.
To summarise my time in the training, I perfomed the following projects:

- Writing and integrating Jenkins Pipelines and jobs into GitLab projects, streamlining continuous integration and deployment processes.

- Setting up AWS infrastructure and provisioning resources such as instances, CloudWatch, SNS, and Application Load Balancers using Terraform as Infrastructure as Code (IaC), optimizing resource management and cost-efficiency.

- Leveraging Kubernetes (GKE) for container orchestration, deploying and managing applications efficiently in a cloud-native environment.

- Setting-up production ready AWS managed Kubernetes cluster using terraform.

- Writing bash and Python scripts to automate everyday tasks, enhancing productivity and reducing manual effort Managing Docker containers with Dockerfiles and compose scripts, facilitating containerized application deployment and maintenance.
